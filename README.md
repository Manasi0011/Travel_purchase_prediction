# Travel Package Purchase Prediction | iNeuron | Internship Project

## Problem Statement :

Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing global industries and tourism forecasting is becoming an increasingly important activity in planning and managing the industry. Because of high fluctuations of tourism demand, accurate predictions of purchase of travel packages are of high importance for tourism organizations. 

The goal is to predict whether the customer will purchase the travel or not.


## Dataset :

The dataset is taken from iNeuron Portal

## Approach :

Applying the machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing to build a solution that should able to predict the premium of the person's health insurance.

- **Data Exploration :** Exploring the dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly and seaborn.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis :** Plotted different graphs to get more insights about dependent and independent variables/features.
- **Feature Transformation :** Numerical features preprocessed and Categorical features encoded.
- **Model Building :** In this step, first dataset Splitting is done. After that model is trained on different Machine Learning Algorithms such as:
  1) Logistic Regression
  2) Decision Tree
  3) XGBoost
- **Model Selection :** Tested all the models to check the Confusion Matrix and other measures
- **Pickle File** : Selected model as per the best recall value and accuracy and high AUC ROC and created pickle file using pickle library.
- **Webpage & Deployment :** Created a web application that takes all the necessary inputs from the user & shows the output. Then deployed project on the Heroku Platform.
